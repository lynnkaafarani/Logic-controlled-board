# Logic-controlled-board
The Logic-Controlled Board is a dynamic switching system with four switches and four color-matched lamps (red, green, blue, yellow), designed to change behavior based on the last switch turned off with some tricks.
The file includes quartus and circuitos implementations. Moreover, a file documentation explaining the project's steps and a powerpoint presentation that talks about the project briefly.
